# What is this?
This monorepo serves to demonstrate many different ways to accomplish a simple task: playing rock, paper, or scissors!

## Which languages are supported?
I will be writing this in the top 10 programming languages according to the [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024). I have excluded TypeScript, because let's be honest... it is just JavaScript with type annotations, as well as HTML and SQL because they are irrelevant to this use-case. Additionally, I have excluded Mathematica simply because I know nothing about it. Maybe I will add it in the future.

For now, here is the list:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Java
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] C++
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C
- [x] Rust
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Shell
